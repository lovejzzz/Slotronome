1. Project Overview
-------------------

Name: Slotronome
Goal: To help music learner adapt different tempo in practice
Description: I want the metronome looks and works like a slot machine, include the roller, make it real rolling animation. It will randomize a tempo with the range that user set. It will have different time signature, user can change the accent on beat. It can auto change tempo after certain bars that user set, can be random again or just add a number to it. (example, every 4 bars add 2 to the tempo). In the range set section, if user set the start and end point to the same number, this will work like a normal metronome.
